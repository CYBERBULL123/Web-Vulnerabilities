### **Browser Cache Poisoning**

**Description:**
Browser Cache Poisoning is a type of web vulnerability where an attacker manipulates the content stored in a browser's cache to serve malicious content to users. When a user accesses a legitimate website, the attacker’s manipulated content is loaded from the cache instead of the legitimate content, leading to potential security risks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), phishing, or other attacks.

### **How Browser Cache Poisoning is Done by Malicious Actors**

1. **Identifying Cacheable Responses**: 
   - The attacker first identifies responses that can be cached by the browser, typically through HTTP headers like `Cache-Control` or `Expires`.

2. **Injecting Malicious Content**:
   - The attacker crafts a request to the server with specific parameters or payloads that cause the server to respond with content that can be cached. This content may include malicious scripts or redirects.

3. **Poisoning the Cache**:
   - Once the server’s response is cached in the victim's browser, the attacker ensures that the malicious content is stored. When the victim revisits the site or a related page, the cached content is served instead of the original.

4. **Exploiting the Poisoned Cache**:
   - The attacker exploits the poisoned cache by triggering the victim to revisit the affected page. The malicious content is executed in the victim's browser, leading to various attacks such as XSS, data theft, or session hijacking.

### **Countermeasures and Code Snippets**

1. **Use Non-Cacheable Responses for Sensitive Data**
   - Ensure that sensitive or user-specific data is never cached by the browser. This can be done by setting appropriate HTTP headers.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```http
     Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0
     Pragma: no-cache
     Expires: 0
     ```
   - **Explanation**: This prevents the browser from storing any sensitive information in the cache.

2. **Use Strong Cache Validation**
   - Implement strong cache validation to ensure that cached content is still valid and hasn’t been tampered with.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```http
     Cache-Control: private, max-age=0, no-cache
     ETag: "unique-identifier"
     ```
   - **Explanation**: This forces the browser to revalidate the cache with the server before serving it to the user.

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Implement a strict Content Security Policy to control the sources from which scripts and other resources can be loaded.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```http
     Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'
     ```
   - **Explanation**: This reduces the impact of any malicious content that might be served from the cache by limiting where scripts can be loaded from.

4. **Cache Busting Techniques**
   - Use cache-busting techniques, such as appending versioning parameters to resource URLs, to ensure that users always get the latest version of a resource.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css?v=1.0.1">
     <script src="app.js?v=1.0.1"></script>
     ```
   - **Explanation**: By changing the version parameter, the browser is forced to fetch a fresh copy of the resource.

5. **Use HTTPS and HSTS**
   - Serve your website over HTTPS and implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that could poison the cache.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```http
     Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
     ```
   - **Explanation**: HSTS ensures that the browser only communicates with the server over a secure HTTPS connection, reducing the risk of cache poisoning through MITM attacks.

6. **Secure Handling of Query Parameters**
   - Ensure that URLs with query parameters are either not cached or are carefully validated before caching.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```http
     Cache-Control: private, no-cache, no-store
     ```
   - **Explanation**: This prevents cache poisoning through URLs that contain user-specific data or query parameters.

7. **Implement Content Integrity Checks**
   - Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure that cached scripts or resources have not been tampered with.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```html
     <script src="https://example.com/script.js" integrity="sha384-oqVuAfXRKap7fdgcCY5uykM6+R9GqQ8K/ux8tER4HfqgJ4H5ux/fA==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
     ```
   - **Explanation**: SRI ensures that the resource being loaded is exactly what the developer intended and hasn't been altered.

8. **Implement Secure Cache-Control Headers**
   - Set secure cache-control headers on dynamic or sensitive content to prevent it from being cached.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```http
     Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
     ```
   - **Explanation**: This tells the browser to never store the response in the cache, ensuring that each request gets fresh content from the server.

9. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scanning to detect any cache-related vulnerabilities.
   - **Explanation**: Regular audits help in identifying and mitigating cache poisoning risks before they can be exploited.

10. **Use SameSite Cookies**
    - Implement `SameSite` cookies to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks that could lead to cache poisoning.
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```http
      Set-Cookie: sessionid=abc123; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict
      ```
    - **Explanation**: This reduces the risk of attackers using CSRF to inject malicious content into the browser cache.

11. **Limit Cache Duration**
    - Limit the duration for which content is cached to minimize the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit the cache.
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```http
      Cache-Control: max-age=60
      ```
    - **Explanation**: This tells the browser to only cache the content for 60 seconds, after which it must revalidate with the server.

12. **Ensure CORS Configuration**
    - Properly configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to prevent unauthorized domains from caching your resources.
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```http
      Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://yourdomain.com
      Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
      ```
    - **Explanation**: This ensures that only trusted domains can access and potentially cache your resources.

### **Conclusion**

Browser Cache Poisoning is a serious vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers to serve malicious content to users. By implementing a combination of the above countermeasures, you can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack. Always ensure that sensitive content is not cached, validate cached content, and use strong security practices like HTTPS, HSTS, and CSP to protect your users from potential threats.
