### Resource Exhaustion

**Description:**
Resource Exhaustion refers to a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack where an attacker aims to deplete system resources (such as CPU, memory, disk space, or network bandwidth) to make a system or service unavailable to legitimate users. This can be achieved through various means, such as flooding the system with excessive requests, exploiting resource leaks, or manipulating resource allocation.

### How Resource Exhaustion is Done by Malicious Actors:

1. **Request Flooding:**
   - **Process:** The attacker sends an overwhelming number of requests to a server or service, consuming server resources like CPU and memory.
   - **Example:** Sending a flood of HTTP requests to a web server.

2. **Memory Exhaustion:**
   - **Process:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities to allocate large amounts of memory or to create numerous objects, causing the system to run out of memory.
   - **Example:** Triggering a memory leak by submitting data that causes the application to store excessive amounts of information in memory.

3. **Disk Space Exhaustion:**
   - **Process:** The attacker uploads large files or creates numerous temporary files, consuming available disk space.
   - **Example:** Uploading large files to a web server or generating excessive log files.

4. **CPU Exhaustion:**
   - **Process:** The attacker exploits computationally intensive operations to consume CPU cycles.
   - **Example:** Sending requests that trigger complex database queries or resource-intensive operations.

5. **Network Bandwidth Exhaustion:**
   - **Process:** The attacker floods the network with excessive traffic, consuming available bandwidth and affecting network performance.
   - **Example:** Launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack with numerous compromised devices.

### Countermeasures:

1. **Rate Limiting:**
   - **Description:** Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests a user can make in a given time period.
   - **Example Code (using Express.js for rate limiting):**
     ```javascript
     const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
     
     const limiter = rateLimit({
       windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
       max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
       message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.'
     });
     
     app.use(limiter);
     ```

2. **Caching:**
   - **Description:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on your system by storing frequently accessed data.
   - **Example Code (using Redis for caching):**
     ```javascript
     const redis = require('redis');
     const client = redis.createClient();

     // Set cache
     client.set('key', 'value', 'EX', 3600); // Key expires in 1 hour

     // Get cache
     client.get('key', (err, value) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log(value);
     });
     ```

3. **Load Balancing:**
   - **Description:** Distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to balance the load and avoid resource exhaustion on a single server.
   - **Example Code (using Nginx for load balancing):**
     ```nginx
     upstream backend {
       server backend1.example.com;
       server backend2.example.com;
     }

     server {
       location / {
         proxy_pass http://backend;
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Resource Allocation Limits:**
   - **Description:** Set limits on resources such as CPU and memory for processes to prevent excessive consumption.
   - **Example Code (using Docker to limit resources):**
     ```bash
     docker run -d --name mycontainer --memory="512m" --cpus="1.0" myimage
     ```

5. **Input Validation:**
   - **Description:** Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities that lead to resource exhaustion.
   - **Example Code (input validation in Python):**
     ```python
     from flask import request

     @app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
     def submit():
         data = request.form['data']
         if len(data) > 1000:
             return 'Input too long', 400
         # Process data
     ```

6. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - **Description:** Implement monitoring to detect unusual resource usage and set up alerts to respond to potential attacks.
   - **Example Code (using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring):**
     ```yaml
     # Prometheus configuration example
     scrape_configs:
       - job_name: 'myapp'
         static_configs:
           - targets: ['localhost:9090']
     ```

7. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
   - **Description:** Deploy a WAF to filter and monitor HTTP requests, blocking malicious traffic that may lead to resource exhaustion.
   - **Example Code (using ModSecurity for WAF):**
     ```apache
     SecRuleEngine On
     SecDefaultAction "deny,log"
     ```

8. **Traffic Shaping:**
   - **Description:** Control the rate of incoming traffic to prevent overload and manage bandwidth usage.
   - **Example Code (using Linux Traffic Control):**
     ```bash
     tc qdisc add dev eth0 root tbf rate 1mbit burst 10kb latency 70ms
     ```

9. **Load Shedding:**
   - **Description:** Drop or queue excess traffic when the system is under high load to prevent resource exhaustion.
   - **Example Code (using Nginx for load shedding):**
     ```nginx
     http {
       limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=conn_limit:10m;
       server {
         location / {
           limit_conn conn_limit 10;
           # Drop requests exceeding limit
         }
       }
     }
     ```

10. **Implementing Backpressure:**
    - **Description:** Use backpressure techniques to signal clients to slow down their request rate when the server is overwhelmed.
    - **Example Code (implementing backpressure in Node.js):**
      ```javascript
      const http = require('http');
      const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
        if (server.getConnections() > 1000) {
          res.writeHead(503, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
          res.end('Server is overloaded, try again later.');
        } else {
          // Handle request
        }
      });
      ```

11. **Disk Quotas:**
    - **Description:** Set disk quotas to limit the amount of disk space used by users or processes.
    - **Example Code (setting disk quotas on Linux):**
      ```bash
      edquota -u username
      ```

12. **Memory Limits:**
    - **Description:** Set memory limits for processes to prevent any single process from consuming excessive memory.
    - **Example Code (using ulimit in Unix-based systems):**
      ```bash
      ulimit -v 1024000
      ```

### Summary
Resource exhaustion attacks can target various system resources, including CPU, memory, disk space, and network bandwidth. By implementing rate limiting, caching, load balancing, resource allocation limits, and other countermeasures, you can mitigate the impact of such attacks and enhance the resilience of your systems. Each countermeasure includes example code snippets to illustrate how you can apply these strategies in practice.
