### Unpatched Software:

**Description:**
Unpatched Software refers to software that has known security vulnerabilities for which patches or updates have been released but have not been applied. This creates a potential risk as malicious actors can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the security of the system.

**How it's Exploited by Malicious Actors:**
1. **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:**
   - Malicious actors identify and target software with known vulnerabilities that have not been patched.
   - They use publicly available information, such as vulnerability databases or security advisories, to find potential targets.

2. **Automated Exploitation Tools:**
   - Automated tools are often used to scan networks for unpatched software and exploit vulnerabilities at scale.
   - These tools automate the process of identifying and compromising systems with known vulnerabilities.

3. **Persistence and Escalation:**
   - Once a system is compromised, attackers may establish persistence by installing backdoors or other malicious software.
   - They may also attempt to escalate privileges to gain higher levels of access within the compromised system.

**Countermeasures:**

1. **Patch Management:**
   - **Description:**
     - Implement a robust patch management process to ensure that all software, operating systems, and dependencies are regularly updated with the latest security patches.
