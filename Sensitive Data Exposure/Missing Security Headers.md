### Missing Security Headers:

**Description:**
Missing Security Headers refer to the absence of certain HTTP headers that play a crucial role in enhancing the security of web applications. These headers provide instructions to the browser on how to handle the content and establish security policies. The lack of these headers can expose web applications to various vulnerabilities and attacks.

#### Common Security Headers:

1. **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):**
   - Instructs the browser to only connect to the server over HTTPS, reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.

2. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):**
   - Specifies the sources from which various types of content can be loaded, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.

3. **X-Content-Type-Options:**
   - Prevents MIME type sniffing by instructing the browser to honor the declared content type.

4. **X-Frame-Options:**
   - Controls whether a page can be embedded within an iframe, reducing the risk of clickjacking attacks.

5. **X-XSS-Protection:**
   - Enables the browser's built-in XSS protection mechanisms.

#### Exploitation by Malicious Actors:

1. **Clickjacking:**
   - Malicious actors may exploit the absence of X-Frame-Options to embed a web page within an iframe, tricking users into performing unintended actions.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
   - The lack of Content-Security-Policy can allow attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts on a web page.

3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:**
   - Without Strict-Transport-Security, attackers may attempt to downgrade connections to HTTP, making users vulnerable to MITM attacks.

#### Countermeasures:

1. **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):**
   - Enable HSTS to ensure that the browser only communicates with the server over HTTPS.
   - **Example Code (setting up HSTS in a web server):**
     ```nginx
     add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
     ```

2. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):**
   - Implement CSP to define a security policy for loading resources.
   - **Example Code (setting up CSP in a web page):**
     ```html
     <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';">
     ```

3. **X-Content-Type-Options:**
   - Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to prevent MIME type sniffing.
   - **Example Code (setting X-Content-Type-Options in a web server):**
     ```nginx
     add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
     ```

4. **X-Frame-Options:**
   - Use X-Frame-Options to control whether a page can be embedded in an iframe.
   - **Example Code (setting X-Frame-Options in a web server):**
     ```nginx
     add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY" always;
     ```

5. **X-XSS-Protection:**
   - Enable the browser's built-in XSS protection.
   - **Example Code (setting X-XSS-Protection in a web server):**
     ```nginx
     add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
     ```

#### Explanation and Code Snippets:

1. **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):**
   - HSTS ensures that the browser communicates with the server over HTTPS, reducing the risk of MITM attacks and protocol downgrade.
   - The `max-age` directive specifies the time, in seconds, for which the browser should enforce HTTPS. The `includeSubDomains` directive extends this policy to subdomains.
   - In the example, the HSTS header is added in the nginx configuration file.

2. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):**
   - CSP defines a policy for loading resources, preventing the execution of malicious scripts.
   - The `default-src 'self'` directive allows resources to be loaded only from the same origin. The `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` directive allows scripts only from the same origin and inline scripts.
   - In the example, the CSP header is added in the HTML meta tag.

3. **X-Content-Type-Options:**
   - X-Content-Type-Options prevents MIME type sniffing by instructing the browser to honor the declared content type.
   - The `nosniff` directive ensures that the browser does not override the content type specified by the server.
   - In the example, the X-Content-Type-Options header is added in the nginx configuration file.

4. **X-Frame-Options:**
   - X-Frame-Options controls whether a page can be embedded in an iframe, preventing clickjacking attacks.
   - The `DENY` directive disallows the page from being embedded in any iframe.
   - In the example, the X-Frame-Options header is added in the nginx configuration file.

5. **X-XSS-Protection:**
   - X-XSS-Protection enables the browser's built-in XSS protection mechanisms.
   - The `1; mode=block` directive activates the protection, blocking the rendering of the page if a potential XSS attack is detected.
   - In the example, the X-XSS-Protection header is added in the nginx configuration file.

By implementing these security headers, you enhance the overall security posture of your web application, mitigating various common vulnerabilities. Always tailor security measures to your specific application needs and keep abreast of best practices to stay ahead of emerging threats.
